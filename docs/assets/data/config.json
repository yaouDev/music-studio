    "title": "About Us",
    "description": "Kammaren, meaning “chamber” in Swedish, is a small Japan-based music production studio.
  We seek to create music that moves beyond a supporting role, that instead works in synergy with other arts and media to form experiences greater than the sum of their parts.  
  Intrinsic to our core is a dedication to precision and intent, grounded in tradition and experience while continually seeking to innovate within the contemporary field.  
  Shaped by training in both Sweden and Japan, we bring together Nordic clarity and Japanese transience in a balanced, delicate fusion unique to Kammaren."
